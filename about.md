# Relocate Edit Buttons Mod
Sometimes you get a lot of editor mods which add their buttons in the edit tab of the editor. Using [BetterEdit](mod:hjfod.betteredit)'s new edit menu sometimes can make these buttons so small and uncomfortable to use. This mod fixes this issue by moving these buttons to the other tab.

## Issues
If the mod has any issues or even makes the game crash, please let me know about it by creating an issue on [GitHub repository](https://github.com/zL4mpY/clone_and_move_mod) or writing me in Discord DMs (loovigmd).
